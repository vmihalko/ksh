note *
note * This build file is in the Make Abstract Machine (MAM) language. It was
note * first generated by nmake, but in the ksh 93u+m distribution we maintain
note * it manually because nmake had too many problems to keep using. The
note * Mamfiles are processed by mamake (src/cmd/INIT/mamake.c); we added
note * indentation to improve readability. The language is documented in
note * src/cmd/INIT/README-mamake.md.
