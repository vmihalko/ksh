	note *
	note * NOTE: this works around the sgi botch:
	note *	 (1) irix 5.* made -ldl optional but warned
	note *	 (2) irix 6.* has no -ldl
	note *	 (3) dynamic progs built on irix 5.* and using -ldl fail
	note *           at runtime on irix 6.* because -ldl is not there

	note * more substance abuse
	note * gdbm's ndbm "compatibility" doesn't supply <ndbm.h>, instead supplies
	note * <gdbm/ndbm.h> which provides K&R prototypes *and* it requires -lgdbm
	note * some <ndbm.h> implementations use -lndbm, others -ldbm, still others -lc
	note * this is why unix is starting to look like windows
	note * this map allows makefiles to use -ldbm on all systems
	note *
	note * and this just in: sometimes its <gdbm-ndbm.h> and possibly -lgdbm_compat
	note *
	note * at least the -l* buck stops here
