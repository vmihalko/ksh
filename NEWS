Any uppercase BUG_* names are modernish shell bug IDs.

2020-06-04:

- Fix BUG_KBGPID: the $! special parameter was not set if a background job
  (somecommand &) or co-process (somecommand |&) was launched as the only
  command within a braces block with an attached redirection, for example:
	{
		somecommand &
	} >&2
  With the bug, $! was unchanged; now it contains the PID of somecommand.

2020-05-31:

- Fix a bug in autoloading functions. Directories in the path search list
  which should be skipped (e.g. because they don't exist) did not interact
  correctly with autoloaded functions, so that a function to autoload was
  not always found correctly.
  Details: https://github.com/att/ast/issues/1454

2020-05-30:

- Fix POSIX compliance of 'test'/'[' exit status on error. The command now
  returns status 2 instead of 1 when given an invalid number or arithmetic
  expression, e.g.:
	[ 123 -eq 123x ]; echo $?
  now outputs 2 instead of 1.

2020-05-29:

- Fix BUG_FNSUBSH: functions can now be correctly redefined and unset in
  subshell environments (such as ( ... ), $(command substitutions), etc).
  Before this fix, this was silently ignored, causing the function by the
  same name from the parent shell environment to be executed instead.
	fn() { echo mainsh; }
	(fn() { echo subsh; }; fn); fn
  This now correctly outputs "subsh mainsh" instead of "mainsh mainsh".
	ls() { echo "ls executed"; }
	(unset -f ls; ls); ls
  This now correctly lists your directory and then prints "ls executed",
  instead of printing "ls executed" twice.

- Fix a similar bug with aliases. These can now be correctly unset
  in subshell environments.

2020-05-21:

- Fix truncating of files with the combined redirections '<>;file' and
  '<#pattern'. The bug was caused by out-of-sync streams.
  Details and discussion: https://github.com/att/ast/issues/61

- Patched code injection vulnerability CVE-2019-14868. As a result, you can
  no longer use expressions in imported numeric environment variables; only
  integer literals are allowed.

2020-05-20:

- Fix BUG_ISSETLOOP. Expansions like ${var+set} remained static when used
  within a 'for', 'while' or 'until' loop; the expansions din't change along
  with the state of the variable, so they could not be used to check whether a
  variable is set within a loop if the state of that variable changed in the
  course of the loop.

- Fix BUG_IFSISSET. ${IFS+s} always yielded 's', and [[ -v IFS ]] always
  yielded true, even if IFS is unset. This applied to IFS only.

2020-05-19:

- Fix 'command -p'. The -p option causes the operating system's standard
  utilities path (as output by 'getconf PATH') to be searched instead of $PATH.
  Before this fix, this was broken on non-interactive shells as the internal
  variable holding the default PATH value was not correctly initialised.

2020-05-16:

- Fix 'test -t 1', '[ -t 1 ]', '[[ -t 1 ]]' in command substitutions.
  Standard output (file descriptor 1) tested as being on a terminal within a
  command substitution, which makes no sense as the command substitution is
  supposed to be catching standard output.
	v=$(echo begincomsub
	    [ -t 1 ] && echo oops
	    echo endcomsub)
	echo "$v"
  This now does not output "oops".

2020-05-14:

- Fix syncing history when print -s -f is used. For example, the
  following now correctly adds a 'cd' command to the history:
	print -s -f 'cd -- %q\n' "$PWD"

	https://github.com/att/ast/pull/442

- Fix BUG_PUTIOERR: Output builtins now correctly detect and report
  input/output errors. This allows scripts to check for a nonzero exit
  status on the 'print', 'printf' and 'echo' builtins and prevent possible
  infinite loops if SIGPIPE is ignored.

- Add a convenient bin/run_ksh_tests script to the source tree that
  sets up the necessary environment and runs the ksh regression tests.

2020-05-13:

- Fix BUG_CASELIT: an undocumented 'case' pattern matching misbehaviour that
  goes back to the original Bourne shell, but wasn't discovered until 2018.
  If a pattern doesn't match as a pattern, it was tried again as a literal
  string. This broke common validation use cases, e.g.:
      n='[0-9]'
      case $n in
      ( [0-9] )  echo "$n is a number" ;;
      esac
  would output "[0-9] is a number" as the literal string fallback matches the
  pattern. As this misbehaviour was never documented anywhere (not for Bourne,
  ksh88, or ksh93), and it was never replicated in other shells (not even in
  ksh88 clones pdksh and mksh), it is unlikely any scripts rely on it.
     Of course, a literal string fallback, should it be needed, is trivial to
  implement correctly without this breakage:
      case $n in
      ( [0-9] | "[0-9]")  echo "$n is a number or the number pattern" ;;
      esac
  Ref.: https://github.com/att/ast/issues/476

- Fix BUG_REDIRIO: ksh used to redirect standard output by default when no
  file descriptor was specified with the rarely used '<>' reading/writing
  redirection operator. It now redirects standard input by default, as POSIX
  specifies and as all other POSIX shells do. To redirect standard output
  for reading and writing, you now need '1<>'.
