- Fix BUG_CASELIT: an undocumented 'case' pattern matching misbehaviour that
  goes back to the original Bourne shell, but wasn't discovered until 2018.
  If a pattern doesn't match as a pattern, it was tried again as a literal
  string. This broke common validation use cases, e.g.:
      n='[0-9]'
      case $n in
      ( [0-9] )  echo "$n is a number" ;;
      esac
  would output "[0-9] is a number" as the literal string fallback matches the
  pattern. As this misbehaviour was never documented anywhere (not for Bourne,
  ksh88, or ksh93), and it was never replicated in other shells (not even in
  ksh88 clones pdksh and mksh), it is unlikely any scripts rely on it.
     Of course, a literal string fallback, should it be needed, is trivial to
  implement correctly without this breakage:
      case $n in
      ( [0-9] | "[0-9]")  echo "$n is a number or the number pattern" ;;
      esac
